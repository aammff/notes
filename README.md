religions: learn about programming languages first, or you'll not understand anything at all.
 - if you differ significantly from buddhism you're in error
 - christianity - unless you're a mathematician, choose a different religion; most popes did not understand it; hints - don't hang people on crosses, don't hang gods on crosses either, don't hang dolls on crosses, don't practice voodoo, you idiots.
 - buddhism - you're all set
 - islam, judaism - you're not the chosen ones, sorry; stop fighting you idiots; god is not on your side, hint: you were not the ones who visited the moon. learn about other religions to understand your own, they have some good ideas and some bad ones.
 - bon, shinto, shamanism, animism, etc. - yeah.
 - sikhs - yea
 - hindhuism - nice myths, good to know.
 - if you're religion was not parodied, you may as well forget about it.
 - if you drink alcohol, your religion is a bachus greek sect - don't be fooled, extremely dangerous idiots. smoke weed.
