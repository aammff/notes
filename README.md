religions: learn about programming languages first, or you'll not understand anything at all.
 - if you differ significantly from buddhism you're in error
 - christianity - unless you're a mathematician, choose a different religion; most popes did not understand it; hints - don't hang people on crosses, don't hang gods on crosses either, don't hang dolls on crosses, don't "practice" voodoo, you idiots.
 - buddhism - you're all set
 - islam, judaism - you're not the chosen ones, sorry; stop fighting you idiots; god is not on your side, hint: you were not the ones who visited the moon. learn about other religions to understand your own, they have some good ideas and some bad ones.
 - bon, shinto, shamanism, animism, etc. - yeah.
 - sikhs - yea
 - hindhuism - nice myths, good to know.
 - if you're religion was not parodied, you may as well forget about it.
 - if you drink alcohol, your religion is a bachus greek sect - don't be fooled, extremely dangerous idiots. smoke weed or vaporize.

other:
  - get art from an artist
  - absolute pitch matters
  - dont eat animals, especially mammals, you're a mammal, aren't you? bible says you can eat animals? would you kill one? bible says many things. don't copy everything you read.
  - money is a proxy for stupidity, don't think otherwise; fractional reserve banking is a scam, maybe biggest in history
  - calendars are a hidden power, don't abuse it
  - don't write non free software, don't build non-free hardware - or you're wasting everyone's time
  - "intelectual property", "patents", "copyright" - no, no, no. you haven't really invented anything on your own, don't put others on a disadvantage
  - don't shave - everything is a quantum computer, hair being its terminal, hair shaving is a major source of errors
  - wars, euthanasia, judicial murders, killings, etc. - don't help people commit suicide - provide medicinal plants instead
  - don't believe "scientific" scams - examples co2, viruses - diseases are either deadly or contagious, not both, for obvious reasons
    - air particulates are a grave danger, don't ignore it
  - science is magic for the common folk, the world is immaterial, sooner or later everybody finds out
  - don't do anything stupid, don't be an useful idiot, don't scam others
  - if you've ever commited any crime, "legal" or not, against your own children - you're a life robber of a worst kind and deserve to lose everything, burn in hell.
